INSTALLATION

The easiest way is to use Composer:

    {
        "require": {
            "lemonweb/deployer": "2.*@dev"
        }
    }

USAGE

See [example.php](https://github.com/lemonweb/deployer/blob/master/example.php) for a simple setup.

TODO

- proper documentation on how to use this tool
- documentation on requirements (php, ssh, rsync, etc.)
- finish translating everything from Dutch to English
- clean up the output during deployment
